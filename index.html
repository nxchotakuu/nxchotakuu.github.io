  <p> Hi! I'm Melanie. I am a 16 year old second year computer science student in junior year of high school. I gained an interested in computer science due to my exposure to computer graphics throughout middle school and growing up with video games at home. I am also fluent in spanish and am the youngest of a family of 4. both my dad and older brother are electrical engineers. Apart from technology, I also am an avid enjoyer of the fine arts; I'm a company ballerina, play music (cellist), and occansionally draw or paint from time to time. I'm looking forward to what new things I'll be able to learn this year! </p>

  <h4><center>Why is this Digital Portfolio so important?</center></h4>
  <p>This portfolio is very important because here is where I can document all my achievements, projects, and experiences from now on. Throughout the years, this page will grow and many will see lots of visible improvement as I get better.I hope to continue this over the years for future employers and colleges to look at, it's a great addition to resumes.</p>

     <b>~Concept</b>
      <p>The game is a text-based pick your own adventure game that with alternate endings, depending on your decisions.
	<br> </br>
	<b>~Motivation</b>
      <p>Our motivation was to make our final project a fun game inspired on chosse your own adventure books we'd read as children and the popularand simple game, The Oregon Trail.</p>
      <br> </br>
      <b>~Code</b>
      <p> The majority of our code at the beginning were print and input statements introducing the player to the game but after the intro, the code was all an intricate maze of functions within functions and Let If statements galore.</p>
      <br> </br>
      <b>~Conclusion</b>
      <p> The game's ending and different pathways seemed to work after many rigorous hours of switching functions around and retyping the same type of code over and over for each segment of the game. However we originally wanted to add images to go along, but we had to get the main part of the game done first, which took almost all of the time we had, and also it seemed to not be very compatible with ASCII, which was the only way we thought we could get images in.</p>

      <h10><font size= "+2"><b><u><center> What did I learn last year in CS I</center></u></b></font></h10>
      <br> </br>
      <center>Last year, I got a feel of what a real computer science class looks and feels like, which was very rough to get used to at first. Last year taught me basic navigation skills within shell and emacs and also just base knowledge of coputer science in general, regardless of language. I learned more about functions and Let if statements and how to make things move or change certain colors. But most importantly, it taught me to learn how to ask questions, especially if you're lost and need help.</center>
